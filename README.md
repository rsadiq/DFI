## Dynamic Feature Integration for Simultaneous Detection of Salient Object, Edge and Skeleton

### This is a demo PyTorch implementation of our IEEE TIP 2020 [paper](http://mftp.mmcheng.net/Papers/20TIP-DFI.pdf).
### We also provide an [Online Demo](http://mc.nankai.edu.cn/dfi).

</p>

## Prerequisites

- [Pytorch 0.4.1+](http://pytorch.org/)
- [torchvision](http://pytorch.org/)
- [opencv](https://opencv.org/)


## Demo usage
### 1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/backseason/DFI.git
cd DFI/
```

### 2. Download the pretrained model 
`dfi.pth` [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N29cJghKKJOHbKgpwR2_Ui64umCE-XG3/view?usp=sharing) | [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WPQiUPo7t8REK3LtmG9_KA) (pwd: **wkeb**)
and move it to the `pretrained` folder.


### 3. Test (demo)
The source images are in the `demo/images` folder.
By running 
```shell
python main.py
```
you'll get the predictions under
the `demo/predictions` folder. The predictions of all the three tasks are performed simultaneously.


### 4. Pre-computed results and evaluation results

You can find the pre-computed predictions maps of all the three tasks and 
their corresponding evaluation scores with
the following link:
